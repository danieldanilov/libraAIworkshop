# Project Tasks

## July 26, 2024

- **Task:** Troubleshoot OpenAI API key loading in `woo_analysis_with_ai.py`.
  - **Status:** In Progress
  - **Details:** Script fails to load `OPENAI_API_KEY` because it expects it in `Scripts/.env.local` but the file might be missing or incorrectly named/located. The `python-dotenv` dependency might also be missing.
  - **Actions Taken:** Created `requirements.txt`, `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`. Added `requests` and `python-dotenv` to `requirements.txt`.
  - **Next Steps:** Advise user on correct `.env.local` file placement and dependency installation.
