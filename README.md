# Libra AI Workshop Repository

This repository contains materials and scripts related to the Libra AI Workshop. The workshop focuses on leveraging various AI tools and techniques to enhance productivity, particularly for support engineers and similar roles.

## Key Areas Covered:

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques and frameworks (CRAFT, RTF, etc.) for effectively interacting with LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
*   **AI Tools:**
    *   **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini:** Drafting support replies, summarizing information, using custom instructions and file uploads.
    *   **Perplexity:** Utilizing its web-search capabilities for accurate, less hallucination-prone information gathering.
    *   **Cursor:** An AI-first code editor for writing scripts, automating tasks, vibe coding, and assisting with complex troubleshooting by organizing relevant information.
*   **Practical Applications:**
    *   Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., analyzing website plugins/themes, organizing files).
    *   Building simple tools or scripts (e.g., `Scripts/woo_analysis_with_ai.py` for analyzing WooCommerce sites).
    *   Assisting with complex support ticket resolution by consolidating logs, screenshots, and documentation.
    *   Generating graphs and presentations.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   The necessity of verifying AI-generated output.
    *   Handling private information securely when using AI tools, adhering to privacy policies (like Automattic's OpenAI agreement).

## Getting Started (Scripts):

Refer to `PLANNING.md` for specific setup instructions for the Python scripts included in the `Scripts/` directory, such as the WooCommerce site analyzer.
