## P2 Post Summary

[P2: Libra AI Workshop: Leveraging AI in Support](https://librateamp2.wordpress.com/?p=11478)

## Key Areas Covered:

*   **Workshop Structure:** The main workshop outline (`LibraWorkshopAI`) includes defined learning objectives, brief interactive demos (prompting, vibe coding), enhanced warnings about AI verification, and a commitment-focused takeaway.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques and frameworks (CRAFT, RTF, etc.) for effectively interacting with LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
*   **AI Tools:**
    *   **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini:** Drafting support replies, summarizing information, using custom instructions and file uploads.
    *   **Perplexity:** Utilizing its web-search capabilities for accurate, less hallucination-prone information gathering.
    *   **Cursor:** An AI-first code editor for writing scripts, automating tasks, vibe coding, and assisting with complex troubleshooting by organizing relevant information.
*   **Practical Applications:**
    *   Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., analyzing website plugins/themes, organizing files).
    *   Building simple tools or scripts (e.g., `Scripts/woo_analysis_with_ai.py` for analyzing WooCommerce sites).
    *   Assisting with complex support ticket resolution by consolidating logs, screenshots, and documentation.
    *   Generating graphs and presentations.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   The necessity of verifying AI-generated output.
    *   Handling private information securely when using AI tools, adhering to privacy policies (like Automattic's OpenAI agreement).
